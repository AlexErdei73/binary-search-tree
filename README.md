## Binary Search Tree

This is a project in the JavaScript part of The Odin Project, where we learn
about algorithms and data structures. This is
[the website of the project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees).

## Usage

To use the code on your computer Node.js has to be installed on the computer. I
suggest to use the latest stable edition. The following commands in the Linux
terminal will build and start the code:

```
    git clone git@github.com:AlexErdei73/binary-search-tree.git
    cd binary-search-tree
    npm i
    tsc
    npm start
```
